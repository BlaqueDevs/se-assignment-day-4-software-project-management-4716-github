Documented: Emphasizes detailed documentation.

Advantages:
Clear Process: Easy to manage with a linear structure.

Predictable: Timelines and costs are more stable.

Thorough Documentation: Provides a detailed record for future reference.

Disadvantages:
Inflexible: Hard to accommodate changes mid-project.

Late Testing: Issues may be costly to fix if found late.
